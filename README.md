 Krabby Patty Landing Page

I decided to make a semi modern landing page design for the fictional food "Krabby Patties". It includes a nav section (header) a home section, and menu section, a CEO section, an about us section and finally a footer. The website includes simple and more complex animation including, hover affects, and a loading screen using a little bit of java by using an event listener. I also used a custom background by using a darkened image to have a modern feel.

The loader animation has the animation its self in css, where it uses a keyframe spin line of code where it is set to rotate 360 degrees at all times until, it meets the script line of code found in the html file. Essentially the script in the html file makes the keyframe stop when the page is fully loaded, therefore showing the website rather than the loader screen.

When first loaded into the landing page, you can either scroll down through the content or quickly use the nav bar to get to the section you need.
